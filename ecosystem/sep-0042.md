## Abstract

STLS aims to enhance user experiences and trust by standardizing a mechanism for defining, validating, and sharing curated lists of Stellar assets, while ensuring ease of integration for wallet and DApp providers across the Stellar network.

## Motivation

While platforms like Lobstr offer curated asset lists, there lacks a universal approach for creating and sharing comprehensive, community-driven token lists on Stellar. The STLS proposes a methodology to facilitate the creation, endorsement, and utilization of such token lists, augmenting consumer trust and simplifying asset integrations across services.

## Specification

The STLS tailors its structure to several key points and feedback from the Stellar community to ensure optimal functionality and integration:

  1. Token List Storage & Format: Given the extensive nature of token lists and limitations of TOML, JSON will be utilized for its capacity and widespread use, ensuring detailed asset specifications without breaching size constraints.

  2. Decoupling List Reference & Data: TOML will manage metadata and references to token lists (hosted in JSON format) to facilitate accessible integration and compatibility with existing Stellar standards.

  3. Stellar-Specific Approach: Due to unique asset structures, the STLS will tailor its standards to Stellar, even if it diverges from Ethereum’s TokenLists standard.

## Proposed TOML Format (for metadata and list reference)

```toml
# Stellar Token List Metadata

name = "Best token list ever"
provider = "SorobanSuperDEX"
version = "13"
token_lists = [
    "https://sorobansuperdex.com/tokenlist1.json",
    "https://sorobansuperdex.com/tokenlist2.json"
]```

### Proposed JSON Format

Incorporating feedback, the JSON format has been adjusted to include optional "comment" and "cross_chain_info" attributes for assets:

```json
{
   "name": "Fantasy Token Universe",
   "provider": "MagicalFinance",
   "version": "1.0",
   "assets": [
      {
         "contract": "GAMER1Y4U6AZEDPMQNRUT7ZH6UUSK6C3TWVLMJ64M3DIMQGYXF4GYQJ5O",
         "code": "DRGN",
         "issuer": "GDRAKET5NDQ4MTZXFA7ATZZA5LQIU7GQNZWKF5TKO5AFJLAAI77XDRGN",
         "name": "Dragon Coin",
         "org": "DragonKeepers Federation",
         "decimals": 4,
         "icon": "https://fantasytokens.com/drgn.png",
         "comment": "Utilized for trading dragon-related goods & evolving in-game dragons." //optional
      },
      {
         "contract": "ELFKEY7VUSVU2FU5DRJUZNIH3K2QM6WYZNAY5UCXIW6L2Y7HD4W6ELFY",
         "name": "Elven Gold",
         "org": "Elven Treasury",
         "decimals": 7,
         "icon": "https://fantasytokens.com/elfg.png",
         "comment": "Official currency of Elven lands, endorsed by Elven Treasury.", //optional 
      },
      {
         "contract": "ORCMINT7R52SZMIQBOVNQZJ5QGN5XC2JFB3MXYUBL4LEZ5I5YDQY3ORC",
         "name": "Orc Steel",
         "org": "Orcish Smith Guild",
         "decimals": 3,
         "icon": "https://fantasytokens.com/orcst.png",
         "URI": "https://orcforged.dapp, domain",
         "comment": "Essential for crafting weapons within Orcish territories." //optional
      }
   ]
}

```

Here:

- `"comment"`: Optional field for providing alerts, messages, or additional information for a particular asset.
- `"URI"`: Optional field, A tuple providing a link to the DApp related to the asset, and description which describes the type of URI.

## Rationale

- **Enhanced Asset Detailing**: The inclusion of "comment" and "URI" fields allows list creators to provide users with enriched information, ensuring informed decisions while interacting with assets.

- **Transparency and User Education**: The "comment" field facilitates the transparent sharing of vital or supplementary information regarding assets, enhancing user awareness and engagement.

## Future Directions & Further Discussion Points

- **List Governance and Maintenance**: Establishing clear criteria and governance protocols for adding, maintaining, or delisting assets.

- **User Engagement & List Endorsement**: Developing mechanisms for user engagement, list endorsement, and possibly implementing a voting system for asset inclusion.

## Conclusion

The STLS proposal fosters a secure, robust, and user-informative environment for managing token lists on the Stellar network. Continuing discussions and further community engagement will ensure the proposal’s refinement to optimally serve developers and users within the Stellar ecosystem.
