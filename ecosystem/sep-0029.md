## Simple Summary

This SEP describes a standard way to define transaction memo requirements for
incoming payments. 

## Motivation

Custodial wallets often use a single Stellar account for all deposits/withdrawals,
relying on the transaction `memo` to disambiguate incoming payments.
Users frequently forget to fill in a memo in their deposit transactions.
Dealing with missing memos may result in lost funds and requires manual actions
from the custodial support staff.

We introduce a basic convention that allows defining memo requirements on the
account level.

Although this interoperability standard aims to deal with a missing memo problem
in the first place, it can be also utilized by a wider class of Stellar-based
applications to designate additional interaction or prerequisites.

## Abstract

An account owner configures memo requirements by adding a data entry that
specifies the whether a transaction memo is required when transferring funds to
the account. Each wallet ensures that a memo is attached before submitting
the transaction to the network. Horizon server performs the same validation
routines before submission and returns an error to the client in case of
requirements violation.

## Specification

To set up memo prerequisites for an account, the owner submits a transaction
with `MANAGE_DATA` operation that adds a data entry with the name
`config.memo_required` (in lower case following SEP-18 notation) and value `1`
(a single character string "1" - ASCII code 49 or Unicode U+0031).

When a user submits a transaction containing a `PAYMENT`,
`PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_SEND`, `PATH_PAYMENT_STRICT_RECEIVE`, or `MERGE_ACCOUNT`
operation, the wallet fetches account details from Horizon
[`/accounts/{account}`](https://www.stellar.org/developers/horizon/reference/endpoints/accounts-single.html)
endpoint for an address specified in the operation `destination` field.

- If the destination account has `config.memo_required` data entry set, the
wallet verifies that the transaction `memo` field is set.
- If `memo` is not set, the wallet shows a notification and prevents the
transaction from submission.
- For transactions containing more than one operation, the wallet performs the
same checks for every operation.

The Horizon server executes the same verification routine server-side when it
receives the transaction and returns `OP_MEMO_REQUIRED` error without sending
it to the network if memo requirements are violated. The implementation of
blocking transactions with invalid memos on the Horizon level does not eliminate
the need to verify the requirements on the wallet level.

## Rationale

Multiplexed accounts proposal by David Mazières is more advanced and
comprehensive solution for the problem described above, but its adoption by the
whole ecosystem and custodial exchanges will require much more time, as well as
development efforts. Specifying memo requirements in a form of data entry
attached to the account introduces a simple way of enforcing transaction
memo requirements without changing the underlying protocol. 

The name of the data entry follows the namespaces format proposed in SEP-18.

Memo type verification routines are intentionally omitted from this SEP in favor
of a separate standard with extended definition of more granular memo
constraints via separate data entries in the future, if such need arises.
For example, `config.memo_required_type` for memo type validation.
